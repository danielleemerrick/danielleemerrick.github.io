        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <div id="AboutMeInfo">
            <p>Originally I am from Texas, but decided to attend OU as a way to grow as an individual. At the university, I am majoring in International Business 
            and Management Information Systems while as being in the accelerated master program for Management Information Technology. Currently, I am a senior and 
            plan on graduating in May of 2022 after completing my Bachelor's and Master's as part of the accelerated program. In my years here, I have had many of 
            opportunities to get involved and be active on campus. I am involved and a memeber of Delta Sigma Pi and JCPenney Leadership Program and in past years 
            been active with CAC Concert Series and Howdy Week. Along with on campus involvement, I have also studied abroad twice in Peru and Barcelona, Spain.</p>
