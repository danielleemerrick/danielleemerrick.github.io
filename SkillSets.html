        <h2>Skill Sets</h2>
        <div id="SkillsInfo">
            <p>These skill sets were developed while taking class that are apart of my major's curriculum. 
            Classes include Personal Computing Prod Tools, Computer Based Info System I, Databases, and Programming I and II. 
            Skills developed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                <li>Microsoft Word</li>
                <li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not all skills, as I have also learned how to use other softwares such as Smartsheets, but are the ones
            I regularly use. Along with learning programming languages and softwares, I have also been able to expand upon my interpersonal skills 
            while learning how to speak Spanish (beginner).</p>
